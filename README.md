# 562_570_576_579_A-Distributed-Systems-Cluster-Simulation-Framework
The project objective was to create a Kubernetes-like framework using Docker.
Main objectives:
1. Add Docker containers which would function as nodes
2. Assign pods to those nodes according to the best-fit algorithm
3. Track the health of the nodes through heartbeat mechanism
4. If the node fails re-assign the pods

Instructions to run this project:
python server.py
